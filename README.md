This assignment was to practice using Bootstrap 4 for Codetalk.

We were asked to create a site on a topic of our choosing using Bootstrap.

We were required to include:

- A container
- Jumbotron with with overwritten CSS for background color
- Mixed mogile and desktop grid system to create a dynamic flexible layout
- Top navigation with custom link color and text
- One CTA button
- 2 images
- H1, H2, H3 tags
- Display class

Bonus points for making the content creative.
